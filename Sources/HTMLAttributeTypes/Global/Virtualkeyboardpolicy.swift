/// Controls virtual keyboard behavior for editable elements on touch devices.
///
/// The `virtualkeyboardpolicy` global attribute is an enumerated attribute that controls how the
/// on-screen virtual keyboard behaves when an editable element receives focus or is tapped on
/// devices without physical keyboards (like tablets and smartphones).
///
/// This attribute can be applied to any editable element, including `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and
/// elements with the `contenteditable` attribute.
///
/// ## Values
///
/// - **auto** (or empty string): The virtual keyboard automatically appears when the element
///   receives focus or is tapped. This is the default behavior.
///
/// - **manual**: Decouples the element's focus and tap events from the virtual keyboard's state.
///   The keyboard will not automatically appear, giving developers more control over keyboard
///   display through JavaScript.
///
/// ## Usage Notes
///
/// - This is an experimental technology with limited browser support
/// - Primarily useful for custom input experiences on touch devices
/// - When set to "manual", developers must programmatically show the keyboard
/// - Can help create custom inputs where keyboard appearance is controlled by specific user actions
/// - Only relevant on devices with virtual keyboards
///
/// ## Browser Support
///
/// As of 2024, support for this attribute is limited. Chrome and Chrome-based browsers (Edge, Opera)
/// have implemented it, but support in other browsers may be inconsistent. Always test thoroughly
/// across devices and provide fallbacks.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// Automatic keyboard behavior (default):
/// ```html
/// <input type="text" virtualkeyboardpolicy="auto" placeholder="Keyboard appears on focus">
/// ```
///
/// Manual keyboard control:
/// ```html
/// <textarea virtualkeyboardpolicy="manual" placeholder="Keyboard won't appear automatically"></textarea>
/// ```
///
/// With contenteditable:
/// ```html
/// <div contenteditable="true" virtualkeyboardpolicy="manual">
///   Editable content without automatic keyboard.
/// </div>
/// ```
///
/// Usage with JavaScript to manually control the keyboard:
/// ```html
/// <input 
///   id="custom-input" 
///   type="text" 
///   virtualkeyboardpolicy="manual"
///   placeholder="Click the button to show keyboard"
/// >
/// <button onclick="document.getElementById('custom-input').focus(); navigator.virtualKeyboard.show();">
///   Show Keyboard
/// </button>
/// ```
