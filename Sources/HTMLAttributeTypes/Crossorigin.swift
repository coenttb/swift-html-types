/// An enumeration that controls how the element handles cross-origin requests.
///
/// The `crossorigin` attribute enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for elements
/// that fetch external resources. It specifies whether to use CORS and if so, whether
/// to include credentials in cross-origin requests.
///
/// ## Usage Notes
///
/// - Valid on `<audio>`, `<img>`, `<link>`, `<script>`, and `<video>` elements
/// - Controls how cross-origin requests are handled
/// - When not specified, CORS is not used at all
/// - For web manifests requiring credentials, use `use-credentials`
///
/// ## Values
///
/// - `anonymous`: Sends CORS request without credentials (cookies, client certificates, etc.)
/// - `useCredentials`: Sends CORS request with credentials
/// - An empty string or invalid value is equivalent to `anonymous`
///
/// ## Element-Specific Behavior
///
/// When the attribute is not specified:
///
/// - For `<img>`, `<audio>`, `<video>`: When placed in `<canvas>`, the element is marked as tainted
/// - For `<script>`: Access to error logging via `window.onerror` is limited
/// - For `<link>`: Requests without appropriate CORS headers may be discarded
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// Loading a script without credentials:
/// ```html
/// <script src="https://example.com/script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
/// ```
///
/// Loading a web manifest with credentials:
/// ```html
/// <link rel="manifest" href="/app.webmanifest" crossorigin="use-credentials">
/// ```
