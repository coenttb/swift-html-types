/// Represents the CSS `loading` attribute that specifies how the browser should load an image.
///
/// The `loading` attribute affects when and how resources like images and iframes
/// are loaded relative to their visibility in the viewport. This can significantly
/// impact page performance and data usage.
///
/// ```
///    Loading behavior:
///
///    eager (default):            lazy:
///    +--------------+            +--------------+
///    | Image loads  |            | Placeholder  |
///    | immediately  |            | until near   |
///    | when page    |            | viewport     |
///    | is rendered  |            |              |
///    +--------------+            +--------------+
///                                      |

///                                | Image loads  |
///                                | when user    |
///                                | scrolls near |

/// ```swift
/// let lazyLoading = Loading.lazy
/// // HTML attribute: loading="lazy"
///
/// let eagerLoading = Loading.eager
/// // HTML attribute: loading="eager"

/// - Note: This is primarily used as an HTML attribute rather than a CSS property,
///   but it's included in this library for completeness when working with HTML elements.
