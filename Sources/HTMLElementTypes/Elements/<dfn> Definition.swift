import HTMLAttributeTypes

/// Represents an HTML Definition element (`<dfn>`), which indicates a term being defined.
///
/// The `<dfn>` element should be used in a complete definition statement, where the full definition
/// of the term can be in one of the following:
/// - The ancestor paragraph (a block of text, sometimes marked by a `<p>` element)
/// - The `<dt>`/`<dd>` pairing
/// - The nearest section ancestor of the `<dfn>` element
///
/// ## Specifying the Term Being Defined
///
/// The term being defined is identified following these rules:
///
/// 1. If the `<dfn>` element has a `title` attribute, the value of the title attribute is considered
///    to be the term being defined.
/// 2. If the `<dfn>` contains a single child element and does not have any text content of its own,
///    and the child element is an `<abbr>` element with a title attribute itself, then the exact value
///    of the `<abbr>` element's title is the term being defined.
/// 3. Otherwise, the text content of the `<dfn>` element is the term being defined.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// dfn {
///     "validator"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Linking to Definitions
///
/// If you include an `id` attribute on the `<dfn>` element, you can then link to it using `<a>` elements.
/// Such links should be uses of the term, with the intent being that the reader can quickly navigate to
/// the term's definition.
///
/// ## Using Abbreviations
///
/// In some cases, you may wish to use an abbreviation for a term when defining it. This can be done by
/// using the `<dfn>` and `<abbr>` elements together.
///
public struct Definition: HTMLElement {
  /// The HTML tag name
  @inlinable public static var tag: String { "dfn" }

  /// Title attribute that has special meaning with the `<dfn>` element.
  /// If present, its value is considered to be the term being defined.
  public var title: HTMLAttributeTypes.Title?

  /// Creates a new Definition element with the specified content.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - title: If present, its value is considered to be the term being defined
  public init(
    title: HTMLAttributeTypes.Title? = nil
  ) {
    self.title = title

  }
}
