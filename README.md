# swift-html-types

A comprehensive, accurate, and type-safe domain model of HTML elements and attributes in Swift.

## Examples

```swift
import HTMLTypes

// Create elements with appropriate attributes
let anchor = Anchor(href: "https://example.com")
let input = Input.search(name: "query", placeholder: "Search...")
```

### Foundation integration for URL safety

```swift
import HTMLTypesFoundation

let url: Foundation.URL = .init(...)

let anchor = Anchor(url: url)
```

## Motivation

A domain model for HTML brings many benefits. In particular, this package improves discoverability of available attributes for each HTML element, for example invoking the search static func on input reveals the available attributes (except global attributes, which should be applied via methods):

```swift
let input = Input.search(
  name: Name?,
  value: Value<String>?,
  list: List?,
  maxlength: Maxlength?,
  minlength: Minlength?,
  pattern: Pattern?,
  placeholder: Placeholder?,
  readonly: Readonly?,
  size: Size?,
  spellcheck: Spellcheck?,
  required: Required?,
  disabled: Disabled?,
  form: Form.ID?
)
```

Contrast this with other input types, like color, that permit a different set of attributes:
```swift
let input = Input.color(
  name: Name?,
  value: Value<String>?,
  disabled: Disabled?,
  form: Form.ID?
)
```

> [!NOTE]
> `swift-html-types` is part of a modular ecosystem for HTML generation in Swift. Rather than building one monolithic package, I created focused packages that compose together: `swift-html-types` provides the foundational types, while other packages handle rendering, styling, and developer experience.
